## Summary
This proposal outlines the development of "Guardians of the Grid," a tower defense game with integrated shooting mechanics, designed using the Greenfoot educational Java development environment. The game aims to challenge players through strategic gameplay, requiring them to defend against waves of incoming enemies by building and upgrading towers that can shoot projectiles. Our goal is to create an engaging and educational experience that introduces players to basic concepts in programming and game design.

## Why This Work Needs to Be Done
- **Relevance or Importance:** The project combines educational objectives with engaging gameplay mechanics, aiming to foster interest in programming and game development among students and hobbyists.
- **Background Information:** Tower defense games are popular for their strategic depth and replayability. Integrating shooting mechanics adds an action element, increasing engagement.
- **Previous Related Work:** Various educational games have been developed using Greenfoot, but few combine the strategic elements of tower defense with direct shooting mechanics. Studies show that combining education with interactive gameplay enhances learning outcomes.
- **Problem Description:** There's a need for more interactive educational tools that teach programming concepts in an engaging manner. Our game aims to fill this gap by offering a fun way to learn Java and game design principles.

## Objectives (What?)
- **Design Specifications:** The game will feature multiple levels, enemy types, and tower upgrades. It will run on Windows and macOS.
- **Critical Issues:** Balancing gameplay difficulty, ensuring the game is educational, and keeping development within the scope of Greenfoot's capabilities.

## Approach (How?)
- **Steps:** Conceptualization, design, development, testing, and deployment.
- **Solution Generation:** Brainstorming sessions, prototype development.
- **Performance Analysis:** User testing sessions and feedback collection.
- **Alternatives:** Exploring different gameplay mechanics, and educational approaches.
- **Decision Making:** Based on feedback, performance, and educational value.

## Project Management
- **Duration:** 3 months
- **Milestones:**
  - Iteration 1 (Month 1): Game concept and initial design
  - Iteration 2 (Month 2): Development of core mechanics
  - Iteration 3 (Month 3): Finalization and user testing
- **Tasks and Assignments:** Concept design (All members), Development (All members), Testing (All members)
- **Dependencies:** Design must be completed before development can begin.

## Deliverables for Each Iteration
- **Iteration 1:** Game design document, initial sketches, and concept art.
- **Iteration 2:** Playable prototype with basic mechanics implemented.
- **Iteration 3:** Final game with completed features, user documentation, and post-mortem analysis.
